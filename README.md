  ## Lecture1
In order to run a C Program on an hardware chip we need to follow the following steps :
* The C program is first compiled and converted to an assembly language program(hexadecimal), we use the RISCV ISA for this course.
* This assembly language program is further converted into a machine language (binary) program.
* This RISCV specifications need to be implemented using a Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL) and an RTL is generated
* The RTL is then intgrated with the hardware and the required output is generated.
